      LaFerrari, project name F150,[4] is a limited production mid-engine, mild
      hybrid sports car built by Italian automotive manufacturer Ferrari.
      <br />[5] LaFerrari means "The Ferrari" in Italian; this is intended to be
      the definitive Ferrari.
    </p>
    Nine conceptual design studies were considered for the V12 hybrid flagship
    in 2011, reduced to five in April 2011 (three by Ferrari Centro Stile and
    two by Pininfarina). Of these, two full-size concepts were built: LaFerrari
    Concept Manta (internal designation: 2011 Model 2) and LaFerrari Concept
    Tensostruttura (internal designation 2011 Model 3). These were unveiled at
    the Ferrari Museum in Maranello, Italy and Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi. The
    final design of LaFerrari is similar to the Manta concept (Model 2).

      <h1>Early history</h1>
      <p>
        Enzo Ferrari, formerly a salesman and racing driver for Alfa Romeo,
        founded Scuderia Ferrari, a racing team, in 1929. Originally intended to
        service gentleman drivers and other amateur racers, Alfa Romeo's
        withdrawal from racing in 1933, combined with Enzo's connections within
        the company, turned Scuderia Ferrari into its unofficial representative
        on the track.[8] Alfa Romeo supplied racing cars to Ferrari, who
        eventually amassed some of the best drivers of the 1930s and won many
        races before the team's liquidation in 1937.
